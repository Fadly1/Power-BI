# Power-BI
My trial on Power BI
This dashboard was created using data sourced online (https://enterprisedna.co/)
It provides a global view of the sales performance of a company showinmg items 
like Sales by Product Name, Sales by Customers, Sales by Salesperson, Trend of Sales for the Perios, Sales by Location.

First step was to import the data and perform some cleaning and transformation.
We imported a total of 6 tables (Sales, Salesperson, Customer, Product, Location and Date).
The date table was created using a date table code that was sourced online (see repo for the code).

Next step was to create relationships between the tables. This will enable easy sorting among the features of table in the main dashboard.
For this to be efficient, there needs to be 'primary keys' that will connect each table to the transaction table (Sales).

The final stage was to play around with the visuals. 
We made use of several graphs and charts provided by Power BI to come up with the dashboard.

This project was made possible through the guidiance of tutorial videos from Enterprise DNA.
